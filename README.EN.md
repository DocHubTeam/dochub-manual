# DocHub - architectural platform for organizations

DocHub was created in response to the current challenges in enterprise architecture and IT systems management.
At its core is the concept of "Architecture as Code," which allows architectural artifacts—such as documents
and diagrams—to be treated as applications compiled from architecture code. This feature opens up the possibility
of applying proven software development practices for effective architecture management and seamless
integration into the production development process.
